# Ricart Agrawala Simulation using SMPL

## Compiling and Running

You can compile the project using make on the root directory:

> make

The generated executable is generated in the bin directory. The executable
provides a --help flag to show available parameters and how to run the simulation.

## Generating the Documentation

In order to generate the documentation, you must have Doxygen installed. On the root of the project, you can just type:

> make doc

## Misc

A more detailed approach of how the simulation was implemented is given in doc/relatorio.html (in Portuguese).
If you're interested in an English version, please contact me.

Some interesting sources that detail the algorithm and its properties are given in doc/links.txt
